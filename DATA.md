# Data Requirements for WiFi Coverage Analysis System

This document outlines the data files required for this project to function properly. Since large data files are excluded from the Git repository, you'll need to obtain these separately.

## Required Data Files

Place the following files in the `vippfinaldata/vippfinaldata` directory:

### Raw Data Files

1. **Hips_WiFi.csv** (~52 MB)
   - Contains WiFi signal data
   - Columns: timestamp_ms, bssid, ssid, rssi, frequency, etc.

2. **Hips_Location.csv** (~619 KB)
   - Contains location data
   - Columns: timestamp_ms, accuracy, latitude, longitude, altitude

3. **Hips_GPS.csv** (~66 KB)
   - Contains GPS tracking data
   - Columns: timestamp_ms, latitude, longitude, speed, bearing, etc.

4. **Hips_Motion.csv** (~674 MB)
   - Contains motion sensor data
   - Columns: timestamp_ms, accelerometer data, gyroscope data, etc.

### Processed Data Files

These files will be generated when you run the pipeline, but if you want to skip processing steps, you can obtain these files separately:

1. **cleaned_wifi_data.csv**
   - Preprocessed WiFi data
   - Generated during the EDA phase

2. **cleaned_location_data.csv**
   - Preprocessed location data
   - Generated during the EDA phase

3. **cleaned_gps_data.csv**
   - Preprocessed GPS data
   - Generated during the EDA phase

4. **merged_wifi_location.csv**
   - Merged WiFi and location data
   - Generated by the integration pipeline

5. **grid_coverage_statistics.csv**
   - Coverage statistics for geographical grid cells
   - Generated by the coverage prediction model

6. **signal_anomalies.csv**
   - Detected signal anomalies
   - Generated by the anomaly detection module

## Data Directory Structure

The system expects the following directory structure for data processing:

```
vippfinaldata/
└── vippfinaldata/
    ├── Hips_WiFi.csv
    ├── Hips_Location.csv
    ├── Hips_GPS.csv
    ├── Hips_Motion.csv
    ├── data/             (generated)
    ├── output/           (generated)
    ├── plots/            (generated)
    └── models/           (generated)
```

## Obtaining the Data

### Google Drive Access

All required datasets are available through the following Google Drive link:
[WiFi Coverage Analysis Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID)

The Google Drive folder contains:
- Raw data files (Hips_WiFi.csv, Hips_Location.csv, Hips_GPS.csv, Hips_Motion.csv)
- Sample preprocessed data (for testing without running the full pipeline)
- Reduced-size datasets for development testing

### Alternative Access

For team members: The data files are also available on the internal shared drive. Please contact the project maintainers for access.

For external contributors: Sample data files with a reduced number of records are available in the Google Drive folder in the "sample_data" subfolder.
