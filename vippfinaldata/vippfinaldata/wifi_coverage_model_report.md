# WiFi Coverage Prediction Model - Final Report

## Project Overview
This project implements a robust WiFi coverage prediction model using the Sussexâ€‘Huawei Locomotion (SHL) dataset. The model predicts areas with low WiFi signal coverage based on signal strength (RSSI) and other derived features, without leaking information from the target variable.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Data Engineering Improvements
- **Fixed data integration**: Implemented proper timestamp synchronization between WiFi and location data with adaptive tolerance (300 seconds)
- **Time window selection**: Added support for filtering data by time window to ensure maximum overlap between datasets
- **Hidden SSID handling**: Replaced hidden SSIDs with "__hidden__" placeholder instead of global constants
- **Hampel filter outlier detection**: Applied robust outlier filtering that preserves spatial variance

### 2. Anomaly Detection
- **Isolation Forest model**: Implemented dedicated anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- **Feature integration**: Integrated anomaly detection results into coverage prediction as additional features
- **Spatial analysis**: Added anomaly density metrics to grid-level statistics

### 3. Modeling Improvements
- **Strict validation**: Implemented spatial GroupKFold cross-validation to eliminate data leakage
- **Feature selection**: Carefully excluded direct RSSI values (mean, min, max) to prevent target leakage
- **Ensemble approach**: Combined Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for better predictions
- **Permutation importance**: Used permutation methods to correctly identify important features

### 4. Visualization
- **Coverage maps**: Generated interpolated coverage maps and identified poor coverage areas
- **Anomaly visualization**: Created maps showing relationship between anomalies and coverage issues
- **Feature analysis**: Visualized the relationship between input features and prediction probabilities

## Final Model Performance

### Cross-validation Results
- **Random Forest**: 70.4% accuracy, 68.5% ROC-AUC
- **Gradient Boosting**: 71.4% accuracy, 69.1% ROC-AUC

These metrics represent realistic performance without data leakage, compared to the original misleading 100% accuracy.

### Most Important Features
1. **BSSID count**: Number of unique WiFi networks in each grid cell (80.3% importance)
2. **RSSI count**: Number of measurements per grid/BSSID (13.9% importance)
3. **RSSI standard deviation**: Variability of signal strength (1.1% importance)
4. **Anomaly metrics**: Anomaly rate and density (combined ~2% importance)

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Context enrichment**: Add user movement mode (still/walk/vehicle) from SHL dataset
2. **Multi-radio integration**: Include cellular signal data for a comprehensive coverage model
3. **Urban morphology features**: Add building height & land-use from OpenStreetMap
4. **Temporal modeling**: Implement time-series forecasting for coverage prediction
5. **Online deployment**: Create a real-time ETL pipeline for continuous prediction updates

## Conclusion
The improved model provides reliable predictions of WiFi coverage areas without information leakage. The use of proper spatial cross-validation and careful feature selection produces realistic accuracy metrics. The model successfully identifies areas of poor WiFi coverage and can be used for network planning and optimization.
