                            <strong>Data Cleaning and Preparation:</strong>
                            Raw data from all sources was cleaned, missing values were handled,
                            and outliers were identified and addressed.

                            <strong>Individual Dataset Analysis:</strong>
                            Each data source (WiFi, location, GPS) was analyzed separately to
                            understand its characteristics, distributions, and key patterns.

                            New features were created from the raw data to better capture the
                            patterns and relationships in the data.

                            <strong>Spatial Analysis:</strong>
                            Geographical patterns and clusters were identified and mapped to
                            understand the spatial distribution of coverage quality.

                            <strong>Temporal Analysis:</strong>
                            Time-based patterns and variations in signal quality were analyzed
                            to understand how coverage changes over time.

                            <strong>Data Integration:</strong>
                            All data sources were merged to create a comprehensive view of the
                            coverage patterns and prepare for modeling.
