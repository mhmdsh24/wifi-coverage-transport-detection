# WiFi Coverage Analysis - Implementation of Recommendations

This document summarizes how the recommended enhancements have been implemented in the WiFi coverage analysis pipeline.

## 1. Transport Mode Detection (SHL Dataset Approach)

### Implementation Details
- **Enhanced `TransportModeDetector` class** with SHL dataset concepts
- **Features added**:

  - WiFi scan density and variability
  - Cyclical time encoding (hour, day of week)
  - Acceleration calculation
  - Trajectory-based cross-validation
- **Speed thresholds**:
  - Still: 0-0.5 m/s
  - Walk: 0.5-2.5 m/s
  - Bike: 2.5-6.0 m/s 
  - Vehicle: >6.0 m/s
- **Model improvements**:
  - Added probability calibration with `CalibratedClassifierCV`
  - Improved hyperparameters for better stability
  - Trajectory-based grouping for cross-validation

### Benefits

- Targeted recommendations for different mobility patterns

## 2. Threshold Sensitivity Analysis

### Implementation Details
- **Enhanced `ThresholdSensitivityAnalyzer` class**:
  - Added transport mode filtering
  - Implemented three-class analysis (good/fair/poor)
  - Added ROC and precision-recall curve visualization
  - Created scenario-specific recommendations (balanced, precision-focused, recall-focused)
  - Added comparative analysis by transport mode

### Benefits
- Data-driven RSSI thresholds instead of static -75 dBm value
- Clear precision-recall tradeoffs for decision makers
- Mode-specific thresholds that adjust for different mobility contexts
- Multiple classification options (binary or three-class)

## 3. Enhanced Visualizations

### Implementation Details
- **Enhanced `EnhancedCoverageVisualizer` class**:
  - Added sample density overlay with opacity scaling
  - Implemented colorblind-safe palettes
  - Added detailed tooltips with rich metadata
  - Created mode-filtered maps
  - Added confidence visualization
  - Improved legends and map annotations

### Benefits
- Clear indication of data density behind predictions
- Better accessibility with colorblind-safe colors
- Rich context with detailed tooltips
- Targeted views by transport mode

## 4. Feature Engineering Improvements

### Implementation Details
- **Channel overlap detection**:
  - Added channel density and overlap ratio calculation
  - Identified potential interference areas
- **AP density normalization**:
  - Added AP density calculation per grid cell
  - Created normalized RSSI based on AP density
- **Removed collinear features**:
  - Explicitly removed `rssi_mean`, `rssi_min`, `rssi_max` to prevent data leakage
  - Added warning detection for leaky features

### Benefits
- More orthogonal features for better model performance
- Better distinction between distance-based and interference-based issues
- Reduced overfitting by removing collinearity

## 5. Anomaly Classification

### Implementation Details
- **Enhanced anomaly detection**:
  - Added anomaly type classification (persistent low signal, high volatility, etc.)
  - Correlated anomalies with transport modes
  - Created transport mode specific anomaly analysis

### Benefits
- Better understanding of different anomaly causes
- Reduced false positives in high-mobility scenarios
- Mode-specific anomaly thresholds

## 6. Integrated Pipeline

### Implementation Details
- **Created `run_enhanced_pipeline.py`**:
  - Combined all enhancements in a single command-line tool
  - Added flexible options for customization
  - Created detailed logging and progress tracking
  - Generated summary reports and visualizations

### Benefits
- Single command runs the complete enhanced pipeline
- Flexible configuration options
- Enhanced reporting and logging

## Summary of Improvements

The enhancements create a significantly more powerful WiFi coverage analysis system:

1. **Context-aware** analysis through transport mode detection
2. **Data-driven thresholds** instead of arbitrary values
3. **Transparent visualizations** showing data density and confidence
4. **Better feature engineering** with reduced collinearity
5. **Improved anomaly detection** with type classification
6. **More accessible outputs** with colorblind-safe palettes

These improvements transform the prototype into a production-ready tool capable of providing actionable insights for WiFi coverage planning and optimization.
